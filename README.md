# Installing TIDE

1. Go to [TIDE Releases](https://github.com/Advance-Technologies-Foundation/T.I.D.E./releases).
2. Download application package. 
3. Install to Creatio via Application Hub: New application -> Install from file -> Select file.

# Overview
TIDE provides you a user interface for synchronizing changes to Git repositories. It'll use clio and Git to synchronize the changes between Creatio instance and source control repository. 

To authenticate Git operations on your behalf, you'll need to generate a personal access token for your repository. See [creating access token](/access-tokens.md). 

TIDE allows you to work with multiple Git repositories. You do all source control operations within a context of a repository. You can see the list of repositories in the *TIDE* section.

# Connecting to a Repository
1. Press *Add Repository* button, go to *General information* tab.
2. *User name* - your user email.
3. *Access Тoken* - paste your personal access token.
4. *Repository Url* - paste repository clone URL. 
5. Press *Save* 

# Installing Application from Git
1. Set your active [branch](#branching)
2. Press *Update from Git* to download the application packages from repository and install the application to Creatio.
2. Now you can start making changes using Creatio no-code tools.

#Source Control
## Reviewing Changes
Go to *Source Control* tab.
1. Press Load changes from Creatio.
2. List of changed files will be populated.
3. Now review all changed files.
4. You can commit all changes at once or pick files to be committed by selecting the checkbox in the change list.

> **_NOTE:_**  In Creatio prior to 8.3.2 the text changes made by UI editor may have appeared in a random order inside Creatio schemas. This behavior was changed to save changes in order. During the first commit with version 8.3.2 you may see more changes than expected, it's fine. The next synchronization will not introduce additional changes.

## Synchronizing Changes
Go to *Source Control* tab.
1. Press *Commit to Git* to commit changes to Git
2. Enter commit message

## Branching
> **_NOTE:_**  New branches have to be created outside TIDE.

Go to *Branches* tab
1. Press *Synchronize branches with repository* to update the list of available branches.
2. Press *Set active branch* to set current working branch. Active branch will be displayed on the left side on the repository page.

# Troubleshooting
You can access log by clicking *View logs* button at the top of the toolbar. The logs will be shown in the right-hand side panel.

## Possible Issues
During installation, TIDE installs to the target Creatio two additional components:
1. Git console. 
2. clio-gate.

If your source control operations are failing, check that those two components are installed. TIDE -> Actions -> Install console git

Also check if your token is valid and has read/write permissions....

## Business Processes 
Open Process log, see what business processes from package *AtfTIDE* were executed. Select a process -> *Execution diagram* to see its execution details. You can [enable business process tracing](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/user/bpm_tools/business_process_administration/trace_process_parameters/trace_process) to get more details.
